    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
     UNGA-DISEC stands at the forefront of international diplomacy, where nations meet to confront global threats to peace and security. <br> <br> From arms control and disarmament to conflict prevention and emerging warfare technologies, delegates are challenged to craft pragmatic solutions in a world teetering between diplomacy and discord. <br> <br> When the balance of power tips and disfavour creeps into every land, a new stage is set—one where words are weapons and diplomacy is key.
      <br><br>
In the halls of UNGA-DISEC, delegates gather not just to speak, but to strategise, address, and redefine global security. From disarmament to warfare, delegates must create alliances and rivalries to forge resolutions that uphold peace—or tip the scales into chaos.
<br><br>When the world goes silent and holds its breath, will you be the one to save it?
