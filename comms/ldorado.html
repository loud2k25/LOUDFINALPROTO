        <li>To speak in the debate, one must raise his or her assigned token or placard.</li>
        <li>The session will be carried out in sequence in all 6 Pillars. Discussion of one pillar should be completed before proceeding to the next.</li>
        <li>After the discussion on each pillar, the host will present a ‘What If?’ scenario. This situation will be used to check the feasibility of the offered agreements, and the floor will be reopened to discuss this issue to eliminate such shortcomings.</li>
        <li>The parties (who operate within their own groups) can engage in in-house negotiations, i.e. make alliances, trade-offs, and negotiate to ensure that their motions are voted on.</li>
        <li>All such agreements should be officially reported to the hosts. Deals that have not been reported will be disregarded, and points will not be awarded.</li>
        <li>The final act is the signing of the final Utopian Charter, which is to be done together by all participants.</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There is a city that exists only in the space between ideals and action. A place of pure potential, waiting for its architects. This is not a search for lost gold, but the forging of a new one.
      <br><br>

      Fifty souls are summoned to the table. Five competing visions for humanity. One impossible task: to weave a new social fabric from the six strings—Power, Wealth, Laws, Defence, Culture and Future. Here, every word is a brick, every alliance a cornerstone. You will debate, negotiate and confront the ultimate test: whether perfection can survive human nature.

      <br><br>
      The path is paved with "what ifs." Each decision echoes into a future you must face. Corruption, betrayal and collapse are not endpoints—they are tests.

      <br><br>
      
This is the experiment. The golden dream is ready to be drawn. Will your signature be upon it?
